\begin{abstract}
    This paper compares a variety of different architectures and techniques
    for the challenge of monocular 3D human pose estimation challenge on the H36M~\cite{h36m_pami} dataset.
    We propose to make use of standard augmentation and occlusion~\cite{sarandi_synthetic_2018},
    volumetric heatmap regression~\cite{sun_integral_2018-1} in combination with a pretrained ResNext101~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/XieGDTH16}
    backbone for the highest score.
    Human joints follow the underlying structure
    of a graph which is why we also examine Graph Convolutional Network~\cite{zhao2019gcn}
    which we combine with evolutionary training data~\cite{Li_2020_CVPR}.
    Our best ResNext101 backed model is able to achieve state of art.
%Briefly summarize your report here. This should include a description of the task you are solving, a summary of how you approach the task (i.e. your method), as well as a preview of the central result. The abstract should be short, i.e. 4-5 sentences. The rest of this template outlines a rough structure how you \emph{can} organize your report. It mentions all the components we would typically expect. It is a good idea to adhere these guidelines, but they are not binding, i.e., you are free to re-organize your report as you see fit.
